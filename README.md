## Description
An open-source Python application, to display, process and store data in real-time from the openQCM Q-1 Device.
The main functionality of the software is the real-time monitoring of frequency and dissipation variations 
of a quartz crystal microbalance through the analysis of the resonance curve.
The application uses the multiprocessing package (https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html).
- includes internal and external packages

## History Changes
version 2.1
- optimized the performance of the calibration operation mode, by displaying the acquired signal in blocks
- optimized interaction with the real-time data graph, by refreshing the timer update at 200ms
- fixed some analyzed bug when the application runs Mac and Linux
- optimized warning in case of error/fault in calibration operation mode 

## Intended Audience
